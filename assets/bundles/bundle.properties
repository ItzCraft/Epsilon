# Items

item.epsilon-item-gelionyte.name = Gelionyte
item.epsilon-item-gelionyte.description = A low-charged, fragile crystal. Can be used for more armor/additional charge. 

item.epsilon-item-calcite.name = Calcite
item.epsilon-item-calcite.description = A flammable material, found as ore, good for buildings and heat.

item.epsilon-item-quartz.name = Quartz
item.epsilon-item-quartz.description = A crystal-like material with very low-charge ability. Very good for making defense againist your opponent.

item.epsilon-item-fylion.name = Fylion
item.epsilon-item-fylion.description = A mixture between Calcite and Quartz. The Quartz charge was lost at the connection, but weak flammability remained.

item.epsilon-item-red-sand.name = Red Sand
item.epsilon-item-red-sand.description = Basically a red sand, have small flammability. Not really useful mineral.

item.epsilon-item-magnetite.name = Magnetite
item.epsilon-item-magnetite.description = Raw iron, which have been infected due to planet's life. It is still can be used in many things, also it is explosive and has small radioactivity.

item.epsilon-item-tantalum.name = Tantalum
item.epsilon-item-tantalum.description = Mineral, made by hard mixture. Have a lot of properties because of mixture, very good for strengthening units.

item.epsilon-item-wierdium.name = Wierdium
item.epsilon-item-wierdium.description = Another mixture, made out of Ozone and Fylion. Flammable and explosable. Hard to use.
